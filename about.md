Greetings, gentle reader! I'm an aspiring theoretical physicist. Born with a crazy enthusiasm for exploration, I'm passionately curious about almost everything. When I'm not studying I'm either coding, sketching or just plain old daydreaming. Many believe that I'm just an absent-minded fellow, always lost in his own sinister thoughts! I am a simpleton but with a big dream â€” to inspire lost souls, like me, through my art and my writing. If this blog strikes you and ignites even a sliver of hope and inspiration, I can run to the Himalayas and die in peace.

P.S. I am a PhD student stationed at IISER-Mohali, and blogging is my new found pastime. Helps me keep my sanity in check. That's the idea at least!
