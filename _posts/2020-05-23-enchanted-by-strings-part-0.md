> **TL;DR**: This series is an ode to a beautiful chapter on polymers and membranes in the classic text of *Equilibrium Statistical Physics* by Plischke & Bergersen. All the contents to be shared are copied. The author of this blog claims no originality whatsoever. Our aim is solely to guide you through the text and open your eyes to a whole new world, which we believe is often overlooked and misunderstood. If you are afraid of math and scary looking equations, then this post and the upcoming ones are not for you. The contents of the text is pretty elementary though, suitable for an ambitious upper undergraduate or a graduate (in Physics presumably).

## Polymers *Ahoy!*

In this series we will study the statistical mechanics of linear polymers as well as fluid and tethered membranes. Other exotic polymer shapes or architectures, like *ring polymers*, will not be discussed here. These are beautiful in their own right and deserve a separate series, which we also plan to do soon. Polymers have captured the attention of physicists for decades now, and the emerging field of Polymer Phyics is still of great interest. Polymers are all around us and are essential for sustaining life. Plastics, DNA, you name it! In spite of this, they have continuously failed to live up to their full glory. Simply because these humble entities hardly capture the wild imagination of the general public as strongly as the mysterious Black Holes or the magical "strings" of String Theory do. It is quite sad a state of affairs. We just wish if it were otherwise.

With this brief preamble, we will now embark on an adventurous journey to the magical world of "giant molecules". We will try to make the material as interesting as possible, adding along extra stuff if possible. Be warned though that things might get pretty nasty at times. However we strongly believe that you will live through every hurdle and emerge victoriously in the end. Hope you will enjoy the ride as much as we do, gentle reader.

## The Journey in a Nutshell

In our study of polymers and also membranes, we will be quite humble and take the simple approach of a working theoretical physicist. We will focus only on universal (or *global*) properties of these macromolecular systems at large length scales. All microscopic details, which may be of utmost importance to a polymer chemist but not necessarily to a fellow physicist, will be ignored. As we are concerned with very long chains only, microscopics play a minor role. We will, hence, employ simple highly *coarse-grained* models. In spite of their simplicity, you will see for yourself the beauty and efficacy of these models in making fairly accurate predictions for some of the equilibrium properties of these wonderful physical systems.

The series will be divided in five parts in accordance to the corresponding five sections of the text. The first part will deal with the simplest model of a polymer, *viz.* the "Gaussian chain". The concept of *entropic elasticity* will be quickly introduced; this is analogous to the Hooke's law of a harmonic spring. In the second part we will talk about self-avoidance and its effects on the properties of a polymer in a good solvent. Then in the third part the statistics of a polymer will be related to that of the *n*-vector model and thus make contact with continuous (or 2nd order) phase transitions. Part 4 will introduce you to polymers in concentrated solutions. Finally Part 5 will give you a flavor of some aspects of the statistical mechanics of membranes.

Like in the case of polymers, our picture of membranes will be a really simple one. We will either talk about a 2D network or mesh of particles (the *tethered membrane*) or consider freely floating particles on an elastic 2D surface (the *liquid membrane*). So we won't be interested in the microscopic details. This approach might anger and disappoint the biologists.  However, our crude coarse-grained models will be sufficient enough to describe and explain large scale properties, which is what we as physicists are really after. These models are beautiful and elegant and additionally provide a nice example of how *dimensionality* plays an important role in statistical physics. Therefore, it is important to study them in the way we do, however idiosyncratic that may be.

## Books & Bibles

Here are some classic texts on the subject for your ready reference:

- de Gennes, [*Scaling concepts in polymer physics*](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2914118) [^1]
- Doi & Edwards, *The Theory of Polymer Dynamics*
- Rubinstein & Colby, *Polymer Physics*
- Grosberg & Khoklov, *Statistical Physics of Macromolecules*
- Yamakawa, *Modern Theory of Polymer Solutions*

<!--That's it! Until we meet again, *adios*. Stay tuned for [Part 1](/2020/05/25/fascinating-polymers-and-membranes-part-1.html) of the series.-->

*Note:* The study of membranes is a relatively new field and came into the scene only in the 80s. Plischke & Bergersen seems to be the only textbook which talks about it. :notes:

With this we end the introductory episode. Move on to [Part 1](/2020/05/25/enchanted-by-strings-part-1.html) of the series next.
Let the fun commence. :trident:
